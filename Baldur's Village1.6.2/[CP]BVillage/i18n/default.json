"festivals.Halsin.spring13":"I too have tried decorating a few eggs. #$e#I believe it's a way to honor the hens' hard work.",

///FlowerDance-Spring24
"festivals.Astarion.spring24": "Darling, can't you see? #$b#Today is nothing but an excuse for people to flirt under the guise of a festival. #$e#I've received a few invitations. I don't feel like participating, though.",

"festivals.Shadowheart.spring24": "So delightful. #$b#A party only for dancing. #$e#Much better than most of the 'parties' I was in.",
"festivals.Arnell.spring24": "A dance... #$b#it's been many years since I've attended something like this.",

"festivals.Astarion.summer11": "It's not a good idea to get me thinking about adding things to that cauldron.$2#$e#Though I can't help but wonder, how would the governor react if I actually did alter that soup?#$e#After all, it would be a taste beyond the limits of mere mortals.",
"festivals.Astarion.summer11_spouse": "What shall we add to the pot later, love?#$e#I wouldn't mind taking a sip myself, just out of curiosity.#$e#Well, it couldn't possibly taste worse than Gale's blood.",
"festivals.Halsin.summer11":"I've just added a bit of herbs into the soup. #$e#A second later, my ears were full of complaints about how bitter it smells. #$e#Why, obviously it smells of the wonderful scent of herbs!",
"festivals.Laezel.summer11": "Someone tainted it with something foul.#$e#Keep your distance from that pot.",
"festivals.Shadowheart.summer11":"I am not going to try that soup. #$e#For me, the world has more worthwhile things to savor.",

///MoonlightJellies-Summer28
"festivals.Astarion.summer28": "A sea of softly glowing jellyfish under the night sky...#$e#It's quite a spectacular sight.",
"festivals.Astarion.summer28_spouse": "Will this year's jellyfish dance be even more magnificent?#$e#They truly are beautiful. #$b#Their radiant glow when they swarm together reminds me of the city lights in Baldur's Gate.#$e#I watched them from the dark, for two centuries, wondering if one would be lit for me.#b#Now I've found it here, my light.#$e#I love you.",
"festivals.Halsin.summer28":"How stunning they are, those moonlight jellies. #$e#Yet it's only one glimpse of the infinite wonders nature offers.",
"festivals.Laezel.summer28": "The starlight reflected in the water... #$b#It reminds me of the Astral Sea.",

"festivals.30888_Gale.summer28": "These glowing jellyfish have a rather calming presence. #$e#They have a way of easing one's burdens, if only for a moment.",
///SVFair-Fall16
"festivals.Astarion.fall16": "Oh, look at all this fresh meat on display here...#$e#The scent of blood is delightful.",
"festivals.Astarion.fall16_spouse": "Darling, what are we putting on the show this year?$ 2#$e#Vegetables? Jam? Perhaps wine? $2#$e#Our farm produce if only of the finest quality. #$b#Let them all marvel at our excellence.",
"festivals.Halsin.fall16":"A great variety of quality farm products are showcased here. #$e#I do hope it not forgotten that everything owes to the nurture of soil and generosity of nature.",
"festivals.Halsin.fall16_spouse":"What do you plan to showcase, my love? #$e#No worries, there's no doubt your products will stand out among the rest. #$b#You can count on my vote.$1",
"festivals.Laezel.fall16": "Do you have confidence in your harvest?#$e#I trust you have shed enough sweat and toil in your craft—else it is unworthy.",
"festivals.Shadowheart.fall16":"I wonder if there is anyone at the fair selling dyed fabrics? #$e#I just realized I have too much black and purple in my wardrobe.$2",
"festivals.Arnell.fall16": "I'd wager these crops are far more wholesome than what those shady vendors sell in Baldur's Gate.",
"festivals.Emmeline.fall16": "Dear, I know your farm goods are the best. #$e# - just perhaps not in the animal products category. #$e#No one is more attentive to the farm animals than Shadowheart.",
"festivals.30888_Gale.fall16": "I remind myself—constantly, might I add—to keep a firm grip on my coin purse. #$e#There are simply too many things I wish to acquire... #$e#To let a masterful chef step into a fair like this is rather akin to casting a ravenous rodent into a granary...#$b#The outcome is inevitable.",
"festivals.Alfira.fall16": "Oh, this is just wonderful... #$e#seeing all this beautiful produce and the joyful smiles on everyone's faces makes me want to cry...",
"festivals.Rolan1.fall16": "What's the purpose of such event? #$b#I'm not interested in anything except for the wine. #$b#But they might have some ingredients my tavern could use.$2",
///Eve-Fall27
"festivals.Astarion.fall27": "Ha, my sweet, look at those fools #$b#—all spooked and shaken by some lousy props!#$e#They should save their screams for what's truly terrifying.$1",
"festivals.Astarion.fall27_spouse": "These ridiculous decorations and phoney ghosts are only good enough to entertain children. #$b#But if you want something truly thrilling, love, perhaps I will give you a special treat tonight *winks*.$4",
"festivals.Halsin.fall27":"The festive atmosphere seems to invite everyone in. #$e#No harm in enjoying some childlike joy.",
"festivals.Halsin.fall27_spouse":"How I want to invite the Baldurian children to this event.#$e#They live with heavy burden and too much at stake. #$e#How beautiful it would be if they could finally have some real fun here.",
"festivals.Laezel.fall27": "Parlor tricks and nonsense. #$e#Unless it's a ghaik, it's not worth my blade.",
"festivals.Shadowheart.fall27": "So much for their costumes. #$e#They are going to crap their pants if I bring some props from the Sharran temple in Baldur's Gate.",
"festivals.30888_Gale.fall27": "Tell me, @, do you think I possess a certain #$b#...spectral finesse? #$e#A knack for the ethereal arts, if you will? #$e#Before I was barred from such endeavors, I took great delight in weaving illusions on days like these. Sent shivers down the spines of students and scholars alike. #$b#A harmless bit of arcane mischief, really! #$e#Though, I suspect the faculty saw it rather differently...$1",
"festivals.Alfira.fall27": "I don't think a lute is made for this kind of day. #$e#It's too hard to create a sense of horror with it.#$b#Someone told me about an instrument called the Pipe organ. #$e#Have you heard of it, @?$1",
"festivals.Rolan1.fall27": "I would advise against exploring that maze.#$e#I think they put some real ones in there.$2",
///Ice Festival-winter8
"festivals.Astarion.winter8": "Ah, I hate winter. #$e#%No matter how many layers I put on it's never enough. #$e#My blood is practically freezing just by standing here.",
"festivals.Astarion.winter8_spouse": "Oh, darling, here you are! $1#$b#So, are you participating in those events this year? $8#$e#Sweetheart, you're the only thing that makes me feel warm in this dreadful weather. $1$e#Look at these people—all over the moon for catching a big fish from the ice water.$1#$e#These villagers are so simple. #$b#It's almost enviable.",
"festivals.Halsin.winter8":"Freshly caught fish is such a unique delicacy. #$e#I would really love to buy some of everyone's ice-fishing hauls",
"festivals.Halsin.winter8_spouse":"My love, would you be so kind to come a little closer? #$b#I'm feeling a bit cold. #$e#The bear inside me needs to hibernate, it seems, even not willing to be bought with delicious food within reach.$1",
"festivals.Laezel.winter8": "Go on, @. Prove your strength. #$e#Let's see what prizes you can seize.",
"festivals.Shadowheart.winter8": "Be grateful that it's just normal fish that are coming out of the ice.",
"festivals.30888_Gale.winter8": "Ah, ice-fishing! #$b#People say it builds character. #$e#Test one's patience, sharpens the mind. #$e#Me? I shall certainly work on my patience by attempting to secure a fine catch.$3",
///Squid
"Astarion.Dialogue.SquidFest": "It's strange to see so many people gathering on the beach.#$e#I mean, just to do this, in this cold weather...#$e#My goodness. $2",
"Halsin.Dialogue.SquidFest": "Cunning and witty they are, the squids. #$b#I often hold them in deep respect.$2",
///IceFishing
"Astarion.Dialogue.wonIceFishing": "Oh, darling, you are the town's best ice fisher! $1#$e#That was remarkable what you did.#$e#Although, I must ask, what exactly are we keeping those squids for?#$e#",
"Halsin.Dialogue.wonIceFishing": "What a lively festival. #$e#I'm also a skilled fisherman actually, even without a fishing rod.",
///WinterStar-Winter25
"festivals.Astarion.winter25":"It's freezing, but I still left the house. $1#$e#What is it? You want to give me a gift as well?",
"festivals.Astarion.winter25_spouse":"Oh, love, here you are. #$b#So, are you still giving out gifts to everyone this year? #$e#I don't mean you should count every penny, but do consider our budget when you plan for the them.#$e#Faerûn's currency isn't accepted here. $2",
"festivals.Halsin.winter25":"Even in such freezing weather, the festival still calls for a big gathering. #$e#Townsfolks here are truly resilient.",
"festivals.Halsin.winter25_spouse":"My love, what gift have you prepared? #$e#I wrapped up my proudest gift with a delicate package, so I do hope whoever receive it takes a liking for it.#$e#...Honey? How did you know it was honey?$2",
"festivals.Laezel.winter25":"Shivering in the cold for some petty baubles? #$b#How foolish.#$e#...Though I do not mind the excitement of unraveling a gift box.",
"festivals.Shadowheart.winter25":"I would still be looking forward to this festival if it weren't for the last time I was given a pair of broken glasses from someone.$2",
"festivals.Arnell.winter25":"I was just reminiscing about the past year with the other folks in the village. #$e#It warms my heart to see them growing more accepting of our family.",
"festivals.Emmeline.winter25":"Dear, aren't you a bit lightly dressed? #$e#Do layer up in weather like this - wouldn't want you catching cold.",
"festivals.30888_Gale.winter25":"Lewis informed me that gifts are exchanged at random. #$e#Such a thrilling moment---the joy of receiving a gift!",

"Halsin.MarriageDialogue.Bad_3": "Sometimes, I feel like you're struggling to stay with me. #$e#Nature teaches us that anything against its essence cannot last. #$e#If you truly can't go on, just tell me the truth, no matter how much I wish it weren't so.$2",
"Halsin.MarriageDialogue.Bad_4": "Love can give people immense strength, but sometimes it's not enough to keep them together. #$e#If this relationship has become a burden for you, please don't force it. #$e#I don't want to see you live in pain.$2",
"Halsin.MarriageDialogue.Bad_5": "My love, I've faced countless hardships, but none would hurt more than knowing you've grown weary of me. #$e#If the day comes when you no longer need me, I promise I won't bother you anymore.",

"Halsin.MarriageDialogue.Bad_8": "Nature has many mysteries, but I've found that human emotions are far more complex. #$e#My dear, I feel there's some distance between us recently. #$e#I hope I'm just imagining it.",
"Halsin.MarriageDialogue.Bad_9": "Oh, Oak Father, can you tell me why my beloved has changed their heart? #$e#My love, I feel like you're unhappy with our relationship. #$e#Is it time...for me to let go?$2",

///Summer         
"Halsin.MarriageDialogue.summer_1": "Summer is here, and with this heat, I'd rather not wear clothes if I can avoid it. #$e#Clothes are such unnatural restraints. #$e#Would that shock anyone? If so, fine. Perhaps we'll save that honesty for bed.$3",
"Halsin.MarriageDialogue.summer_10": "Tomorrow there's a big feast, and I was asked to contribute something to the soup. #$e#I picked something a bear would enjoy, but Lewis suggested I choose something easier for humans to chew.",

///Spring
//Spring 0 hearts
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.Mon": "Word has it that you've got a pretty big farm, @. #$e#I'm almost jealous. #$e#I wonder how many barns I could build to raise more animals if I had one. $3",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.Tue": "I've been constantly awakened by the noises of Lae'zel training. #$e#Why is she so persistent when there are no more monsters or demons chasing us? #$e#Well, perhaps she's waiting to defend us when dinosaurs destroy our houses.",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.Wed": "What are you planting this time, @? #$e#Just watch out, okay? #$e#You probably wouldn't want to be in my shoes. #$e#I just realized I can't make ends meet after selling my animals to Marnie, which I had been preparing for a long time.$2",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.Thu": "I heard that you are quite the adventurous kind. #$e#I hope you get fully prepared. #$e#You don't really want to take on monsters with your hoe, I assume?",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.Fri": "Did you notice the newly born buds on the trees? #$e#Can't believe how nature just wiped them out during winter. #$b#But hey, at least they've come back to life.",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.Sat": "Have you ever tried growing strawberries on your farm? #$e#I like their taste. #$b#Unfortunately, every time I come across some, they're either extremely expensive or already past their growing season. #$b#Sometimes you should not underestimate the cost of living even in a tiny village.",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.Sun": "Folks from the nearby village taught me how to gather ingredients by picking wild plants. #$e#I once questioned if it's safe or clean, but now I find it appealing. #$e#Giving me more anticipation for those late-night strolls.",
//Spring 4 Hearts
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.Mon4": "I met a dwarf from the mine a while ago. #$e#He told me about their conflicts with another kind, which reminded me of witnessing the eternal war between two goddesses. #$e#Though it feels so far away, almost like another life.",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.Tue4": "I chased a butterfly in the woods. #$e#I had to give up when it soared over the running river. #$e#Perhaps I had thought about giving it some freedom. #$e#Though it will accompany me for a longer time as a fine specimen.$2",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.Wed4": "Did you know that there are a lot of mysterious, little-known locations deep inside the valley? #$e#Who built them, I wonder? #$e#Even though I still believe they are just obscure, I did find many rare materials. #$b#So, I am grateful after all.",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.Thu4": "Do you know if they have apple and plum pies at Gus' saloon? #$e#I really need to get a new one before my mother finds out about the burnt pits in the bin. #$e#I wanted to give her a surprise, you see.$2",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.Fri4": "I heard that you constantly engage in fights in the mine? Be wary. #$e#Participating in battle offers more than just bravery. #$b#Sometimes you lose many before you even realize. #$e#Especially when you lose consciousness in the mine.",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.Sat4": "Have you met that girl with the purple hair from the village nearby? #$e#She caught my attention, kind of like a reflection of who I used to be. #$e#Fortunately, she has her parents around all the time. #$b#She doesn't need to worry about finding her way home.",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.Sun4":"Do you know how to fish, @? #$e#My father mentioned that he used to go fishing with me at the lake. #$e#Well, despite the fact that it always ended up with me being naughty.",

"Shadowheart.Dialogue.Mon8": "Everything is so delightful in spring. #$e#It feels like I've got everything I ever wanted, living a life I never even dared to dream about. $3",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.Tue8": "I just have to stop by whenever I pass by your farm. #$e#I'm really curious to see how you take care of these little guys and keep them so healthy.",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.Wed8": "Hmm...the flowers. #$b#They smell wonderful. #$e#I'm not sure if it's the pleasure of living here that's boosting my feelings or if this is how they were meant to be all along.",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.Thu8": "Looks like you've been pretty busy lately. #$e#I keep catching you coming out from the farm all covered in mud. #$b#But that appears quite endearing, doesn't it? #$e#You almost look like a busy little wallaby.$3",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.Fri8": "I witnessed a delicate petal drift down into a stream, surrendering to the current, only to be lost from view as it was swept away by a cascading waterfall. #$e#Fortunately, I will no longer be bound to a life of simply drifting along like this.$3",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.Sat8": "My friends and I have shared an unforgettable journey. #$e#I had believed that the challenges here would be a piece of cake compared to what I had faced before. #$e#I didn't even realize that handling those animals could lead to such exhaustion. #$b#But regardless, this is life and challenges of my own.",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.Sun8": "There are moments when it seems as though I'm wandering through a beautiful dream. #$e#I now have a cozy little house of my own, filled with the warmth of many animals, and the flowers I planted are beginning to bloom... #$b#And I met you, as well as a lovely bunch of neighbors.$3",
///Summer
//Summer 0 Hearts
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.summer_Mon": "Most of the time I enjoy walking around in this kind of weather. #$e#Except for those moments when I look down and see mosquito bites all over myself.$5",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.summer_Tue": "Yesterday I came across a group of people from Faerûn at the Elfverse Tavern. #$e#All of them were drunk. That scene... #$e#Never mind. I guess I'll forget about it soon. #$b#I am very good at forgetting.",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.summer_Wed": "Do you have any pets on the farm, @? #$e#I once had a pet rat, though the memories of it have faded over time. #$e#At times, I find myself longing for something to fill the void. #$e#I believe Lae'zel would probably pick hamsters over other pets, so I wouldn't have to hear her complain about them losing fur or gnawing on her furniture again.$2",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.summer_Thu": "Ummm...I have chicken feathers on my shirt? #$e#Well, I just had a rough battle with them and still couldn't tame these feral animals. #$e#I have to confess, these chicks are more challenging to deal with than any of those harpies.$2 #$e#I believe it's time to seek advice from Shane in the nearby village.",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.summer_Fri": "I recently brewed some cider. #$e#Rest assured. #$b#I only indulge a little from time to time. #$e#I'd hate to embarrass myself like those guys who roll in late at the Elfverse Tavern.$2",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.summer_Sat": "I hardly used magic when I was working on the farm. #$e#I wish to spare my parents from any additional stress, since they've lost their powers, while I long to embrace the world around me fully.",

//Summer 4 Hearts
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.summer_Mon4": "What are your thoughts on the flowers in my garden? #$e#I like planting flowers, longing to be surrounded by vibrant colors each day. #$b#I'm weary of the shadows.$2",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.summer_Tue4": "It's sweltering today. #$b#I can feel the sweat drooling from my bangs. #$e#I get it now—why everyone seems to be quite critical about my hair. #$e#...They haven't even seen the old version.$2",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.summer_Wed4": "Summer's a great time for fishing. #$e#I used to believe the fish from Baldur's Gate were the best. #$b#But after trying the fish here, I ended up tossing all the pickled fish I brought from Baldur's Gate...",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.summer_Thu4": "I had my nearly worn-out weapons re-hardened by the blacksmith in the nearby village. #$e#I know I'll probably never use them again in the future, yet I still hold onto them with great care. #$e#Maybe I'm just... used to being vigilant.",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.summer_Fri4": "Reuniting with long-lost parents is no simple task, let alone having a cutting roommate. #$e#Though Lae'zel and I got along just fine unexpectedly. #$e#It didn't turn out to be as intense as I expected.$2",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.summer_Sat4": "Halsin taught me how to set up beehives on the farm. #$b#But that was it for me when those bees stung my dear calf. #$e#I gave up completely.$2",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.summer_Sun4": "I caught a raccoon searching through the trash, looking for leftovers the other day. #$e#I intended to make her regret it. #$b#But I let her go when I suddenly realized that I used to do pretty much the same thing when I was out exploring in the wild.$2",
//Summer 8 Hearts
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.summer_Mon8": "I find comfort in lying on the summer grass, gazing at the stars that appear so clear and close. #$e#It makes me feel like everything is bright and promising.$3",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.summer_Tue8": "Living here seemed to isolate me from the influence of Shar, a shadow that weighed heavily on my heart. #$e#My mind has never been clearer. #$e#Everything is so bright and vivid. #$b#Even the injury on my hand rarely feels painful anymore.$3",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.summer_Wed8": "Sometimes I gaze into my own reflection in the river. #$e#It resembled a mirror, yet this time, it couldn't take away any more of my memories.$2",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.summer_Thu8": "I can't help but notice how hard you work every time I pass by your farm. #$e#Before you pass out from heatstroke, I do hope you learn to balance work and rest.",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.summer_Fri8": "@, care for a walk on the beach? #$e#We can pick up some shells from the shore or maybe build a sandcastle. #$b#Or we could even take a swim together under the stars at night...",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.summer_Sat8": "In truth, there are moments when I find myself hoping to meet you along the way. #$e#I realize I've never had a confidant like you— #$b#and if I ever did, it has faded from my memory.",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.summer_Sun8": "I never thought about how I was going to shape my future; I was accustomed to living under orders and domination. #$b#But now, I will choose every step that follows for myself. #$e#I am prepared to face any consequences that come my way. #$b#At least, I have regained my freedom.",
  ///Fall
//Fall 0 Hearts
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.fall_Mon": "We really start to appreciate things only after they've gone, right? #$e#I just sold a few chicks to Marnie. #$e#I've come to realize that I miss them a lot...",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.fall_Tue": "I love to smell the fresh scent of the fields after rain. #$b#But I find it frustrating to come home and see mud scattered across the floor.$2",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.fall_Wed": "I thought Pierre was the friendly neighborhood kind, until I found out that his 'friends and family discount' was actually twice the market price.$5",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.fall_Thu": "@, do you have livestock on your farm? #$e#Maybe I could borrow some of your advice from your experience. #$e#The animals on my farm really wear me out sometimes.",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.fall_Fri": "Do you happen to grow apple trees on your farm, @? #$e#I'm thinking about picking some apples for an apple pie. #$e#...Or cider.",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.fall_Sat": "Gale always seems to prefer taking shortcuts with magic rather than just walking around like everyone else. #$e#I don't think I'll use Create Water to help him out with the blaze the next time he decides to use magic to start a fire.",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.fall_Sun": "I prefer eating at home rather than dining out. #$e#I really miss the taste of my parents' cooking; it brings back such a nostalgic feeling. #$e#Always reminds me of a time of innocence and simplicity.$1",
//Fall 4 Hearts
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.fall_Mon4": "I made some squirrel friends in the forest. #$e#That day, I had this big bag of nuts that I had been collecting for them. #$b#And?

"Shadowheart.Dialogue.fall_Tue4": "Father headed out to the forest again and gathered a bunch of wood for the coming winter. #$b#He was quite pleased about it. #$e#I, however, am more concerned about his back. #$e#I think I ought to be the one to bear a greater share of the responsibilities.",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.fall_Wed4": "My father is obsessed with nurturing the flowers and plants in the garden. #$b#His boots are always covered in mud. #$e#Yet I understand that he merely wished for me to experience different colors every day. #$e#The colors that had long been absent.",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.fall_Thu4": "I'm trying to gather some supplies for the cold months ahead. #$e#As my parents age, I wish they have comfort during the harsh winter. #$e#I didn't give them enough company, and now I'm doing everything I can to make amends for that absence.",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.fall_Fri4": "I bought some pumpkins to craft lanterns. #$b#But before I got to it, they were turned into food by my parents. #$b#Then we had pumpkin soup for an entire week.$2",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.fall_Sat4": "My parents have been spending their time at home creating all sorts of new dishes. #$b#They always believe I never eat enough. #$e#What they didn't realize is that after reuniting with my family, everything I ate tasted better than ever.$1",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.fall_Sun4": "There was a time when I believed my fate was sealed among the unyielding cold of brick walls and the harshness of cobblestones. #$e#Now I realize that I long to feel the touch of the grass and the leaves more than anything else.",
//Fall 8 Hearts

"Shadowheart.Dialogue.fall_Thu8": "@, I've realized that you always prepare all kinds of gifts for me, and I feel so grateful. #$e#I don't even know how to repay you. #$e#What do you want, @? $2",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.fall_Fri8": "@, I heard you quit your job and moved here from another city? #$e#I'm glad to have found a new common ground between us. #$e#We've both chosen to take control of our own lives, no matter the cost.$3",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.fall_Sat8": "Look at you, the autumn breeze has tousled your hair. #$e#Maybe you should come over and let me help you brush it out.$1",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.fall_Sun8": "@, the plants on your farm are so well taken care of. #$e#I think it's because you're someone who knows how to take care of others, just as you've always taken good care of my emotions whenever I feel sad.$3",

//Winter 4 Hearts
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.winter_Tue4": "I met some playful children in the neighboring village. #$e#They reminded me of my own childhood. #$b#But whenever I try to dig deeper into those memories, I feel a wave of dizziness, as if a fog refuses to clear. #$e#Perhaps one day, those memories will find their way back to me.",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.winter_Wed4": "I always wanted to take my parents away from Shar's influence, to a peaceful place far from the city. #$b#And now, I've done it. #$b#I think I'm truly fortunate.",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.winter_Thu4": "I enjoy spending time with animals—of all shapes and sizes. #$e#All they need is a warm fire and more affection than they know what to do with.",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.winter_Fri4": "I found a tiny bird frozen in the snow the other day. #$e#Lia and I took care of it for a few days until it regained strength and flew away. #$e#I hope it found its way back home. $2",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.winter_Sat4": "Living in the city always filled me with anxiety—worrying about the future and the outcome of everything. #$b#But here, everything has changed. #$e#This place has taught me to cherish the present.",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.winter_Sun4": "Have you ever tried winter swimming? #$e#The last time I did, I ended up with a fever for days. #$e#My parents have forbidden me from doing it again. #$e#Even though I'm tempted, I don't want to worry them anymore.",
//Winter 8 Hearts
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.winter_Mon8": "This season always makes everything feel so dull. #$e#Until I saw you in the crowd again, and you turned this dull black-and-white picture into a burst of color. $1",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.winter_Tue8": "So cold... #$e#Maybe we should get closer to warm up. #$e#Don't be so shy—come on over, @. $1",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.winter_Wed8": "Actually, it's not that cold when the snow falls. #$e#It only gets colder once the snow melts. #$e#I enjoy admiring the beauty of the falling snow, then returning to the warm room with burning charcoal before the temperature drops too much. $3",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.winter_Thu8": "Did you notice the footprints you left in the snow? #$b#Sometimes I can't help but follow someone else's footprints, letting my own overlap with theirs. #$e#It's like experiencing different life paths. $2",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.winter_Fri8": "In winter, the nights seem so long. #$e#Thankfully, I have my stored of wine and the company of friends and family. $3",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.winter_Sat8": "@, do you know that there's a hot spring in the neighboring village? #$e#In weather like this, it's hard to imagine how delightful it would be to soak in it. #$e#If you'd like to invite me, I think I'd be very happy to join you. $3",
"Shadowheart.Dialogue.winter_Sun8": "Another year is about to pass, @. #$e#Thankfully, I've found a close friend to share the wonderful memories of this year with. $3",

//Love

//Like
"gifts.30888_Gale.like": "I can scarcely imagine the thought and care you must've poured into this gift. #$e#Truly, I am beyond touched. #$b#Thank you!$1",
//Dislike
"gifts.30888_Gale.dislike": "Ah...I assume this gift was not, in fact, intended for me? #$e#An unfortunate mix-up, to be sure...$2",
//Hate
"gifts.30888_Gale.hate": "Hells below! For a moment, I questioned the very foundation of our relationship, but I imagine this was unintentional. #$e#That said...I don't care for this. #$b#No need to trouble yourself with such a gift in the future.$2",
//Neutral
"gifts.30888_Gale.neutral": "Why thank you, but there is no need for you to prepare anything. #$e#Your thoughtfulness alone is more than enough.",
//BirthdayGift
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.AcceptBirthdayGift_Loved": "By the Weave! #$b#I feel my thoughts slipping beyond reason's grasp! #$e#Your birthday gift outshines even the Sage's Signet that Tara once bestowed upon me. #$b#And that, my friend, is no small feat! My deepest thanks to you. $3",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.AcceptBirthdayGift_Like": "A birthday gift, you say? #$b#Fascinating. #$e#I must admit, I hadn't realized that particular scribble on the calendar carried such significance.#$b#But at the very least, you granted me a singular experience I shall not soon forget. #$e#Thank you!$3",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.AcceptBirthdayGift_Negative": "A touch more observation may serve you well before selecting my next gift. #$b#But worry not—I am more than happy to share more about myself.",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.AcceptBirthdayGift_Disliked": "What an intriguing choice as a birthday gift...#$e#It's the thought that counts, I guess.$2",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.AcceptBirthdayGift_Hated": "By the Weave, are you serious? #$e#I don't even know whether to be furious or laugh at the absurdity of it all.$2",

//Regular Dialogues
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.Introduction": "Hello, I am Gale of Waterdeep. #$e#It's a pleasure to meet your acquaintance.$1",
///Spring
//Spring 0 Hearts
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.Mon": "Where do you hail from, @? I come from Waterdeep.#$e#If you've yet to set foot in Waterdeep even once in your life, you're missing out on an experience most extraordinary. #$e#A regret, truly, for there is no place quite like the City of Splendors.",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.Tue": "Was it the heat? Or was it the salt?#$e#......#$b#Ah, greetings. #$e#I've been pondering...nay, agonizing over last night's dinner. #$e#I wonder where exactly things went awry...#$e#A true master of the culinary arts must not permit even the slightest imperfection, after all.",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.Wed": "Unbelievable! #$e#I've just stumbled upon a dinosaur egg in this village! #$e#I was under the impression that such creatures were exceedingly rare.#$e#There is much in this valley that warrants thorough study.",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.Thu": "At last, the warmth returns. #$e#I can only hope the creatures of this land have endured the winter—life shouldn't be squandered. #$e#Nature, for all its wonder, can be unforgiving at times.#$e#Ah, best not let Halsin hear that. #$b#I suspect he'd have quite the lecture prepared...and perhaps a disapproving glare to match.$2",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.Fri": "I'm gathering a few seasonal crops, ingredients that can only be found in spring. #$e#They shall make for excellent additions to any dish, I'm sure. #$e#Don't mistake my arcane mastery for a lack of culinary prowess.",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.Sat": "@, I imagine you must wield your hoe with remarkable proficiency. #$e#Perhaps one day we might exchange notes on horticulture. #$e#Though, I must admit, tending to plants without the aid of magic proves to be quite the challenge for me.",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.Sun": "The rowdy little ones in the village remind me of my own childhood—always finding myself tangled in some mischief or another. #$b#But such is the inevitable fate of those with exceptional talent—a few misadventures are merely part of the journey.",
//Spring 4 Hearts
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.Mon4": "Just two days ago, Tara saw fit to indulge in two free-ranging chickens as her own, a decision that left Shane positively incandescent with rage. #$e#Only after much apologizing and procuring several new blue chickens was the peace between us finally restored. $2",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.Tue4": "Ah, @, your labor is the stuff of legend among my companions and me. #$e#To act on wit alone is to court obstacles. #$e#Only when wisdom walks hand in hand with diligence can one truly forge a path beyond the horizon.",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.Wed4": "The dwarf in the mines has shared with me tales of their people's war against Krobus'.#$e#I must admit, I underestimated this unassuming creature. #$e#They possess far more resilience than I had imagined.",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.Thu4": "I stumbled upon an abandoned witch's hut in the neighboring village. #$e#Naturally, I couldn't help but linger and be engrossed by the remnants. #$e#I wouldn't normally concern myself with objects abandoned by their owners, but the magic... #$b#ah, it was simply too enthralling to resist.",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.Fri4": "I find great pleasure in listening to the songs of birds in spring. #$e#At the same time, I can't help but worry if Tara sets her sights on them. #$e#A fate most unfortunate for any unsuspecting bird...",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.Sat4": "I've heard tales of your ventures into all manners of perilous place, @. #$e#Worry not, I haven't come to lecture you. #$b#On the contrary, I deeply admire the courage and the spirit of adventure. #$e#It is nothing short of commendable.",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.Sun4": "Such delightful weather! #$e#In my adventuring days, I was always pressing onward, ever in pursuit. #$e#Rarely did I think to pause and savor the moment.",
//Spring 8 Hearts
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.Mon8": "Consider yourself fortunate to have crossed paths with the present version of me, @. #$e#I shudder to think of the impression I might've left had we met during my more...unpolished days on the road. #$e#You'd hardly believe me a wizard of any renown, let alone one of exceptional caliber!$3",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.Tue8": "Has this place always been so breathtaking? #$e#@, you look positively radiant amidst the bloom of these flowers.$1",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.Wed8": "I happened upon an ancient ruin deep in the forest. #$e#It's practically humming with arcane power. #$e#There are far too many mysteries in this place, just waiting to be unraveled. #$e#Is your life always filled with such wondrous discoveries, @?",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.Thu8": "Spring brings me joy in three ways. #$e#First, the world awakens, vibrant and brimming with hope. #$e#Second, the magic itself is more alive—perfect for a bit of spellcraft. #$b#And third, well...encountering a kindred spirit such as yourself.$3",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.Fri8": "I see that fate sees fit to intertwine our path amidst this verdant view, @. #$e#A most enchanting tableau of spring, wouldn't you agree?$1",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.Sat8": "It seems you rather enjoy my company, @.#$e# No need to worry! I find myself equally inclined. #$e#I never expected to find a companion in a place such as this, yet here you are. #$b#A surprise most welcomed.$1",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.Sun8": "Perhaps a picnic is in our future, @. #$e#I shall see to every detail of the spread. #$b#And your only task? Arrive and enjoy.$3",
///Summer
//Summer 0 Heart
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.summer_Mon": "Tell me, @, do you share your hearth with a cat or a dog? #$e#I live with a tressym—my dear Tara. #$e#As a child, my parents denied me a cat, so I did what any resourceful young wizard would do—I summoned one myself!$3",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.summer_Tue": "Though I have a library of my own in Waterdeep, the collection here is nothing short of a revelation, surely a feast for the scholarly mind.",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.summer_Wed": "At times, I gaze into the water to study my reflection. #$e#Yes, yes, I do take a moment to assess my visage. #$b#But far more importantly, water is a mirror of the soul. #$e#It urges us to peer beyond the surface and reflect upon who we truly are.",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.summer_Thu": "I met a long-haired man by the sea. Word is, he's a writer. Fitting, given the view. #$b#Perhaps I should share my poetry with him? #$e#It's rare to find a similar mind in such matters—rarer still to be understood. #$b#I do hope his taste is more discerning than Tara, at the very least.",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.summer_Fri": "This village is overfilled with those muttering little sprites. #$e#Even for a wizard of my vast and—dare I say—illustrious experience, these curious creatures are a first.",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.summer_Sat": "Hard work is admirable, but even the mightiest river knows when to flow and when to wait. #$e#Pace yourself, @. #$b#Not to yield, but to seize the moment when fortune smiles upon your labor.",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.summer_Sun": "Such unforgiving heat would sap the strength of most, leaving them weary and wilted. #$e#Yet, I find a certain satisfaction in this test of endurance. #$e#What better time to hone one's concentration skills than when the elements conspire against us?",
//Summer 4 Hearts
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.summer_Mon4": "You're drenched in sweat, @! #$e#Why not pause for a moment? #$b#Grant yourself the rest you so clearly deserve. #$e#The labor of the land awaits you every day. #$b#Such wonderful weather, however, is a far rarer gift.$1",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.summer_Tue4": "@, I must admit—I'm starting to trust you.#$e#Who knows? #$b#If we grow closer, I may entrust you with things only my tressym has been privy to. #$e#A rare honor, I assure you.",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.summer_Wed4": "I hear you manage an entire farm on your own, @. #$e#A remarkable display of skill! #$b#One might even call it a quiet sort of magic.$1",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.summer_Thu4": "Have you met Tara yet, @? #$e#I suspect she'd find you rather agreeable—provided, of course, that you refrain from committing the cardinal sin of belly rubs. #$e#Few have dared, and fewer still have escaped unscathed.",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.summer_Fri4": "With weather like this, we are better off indoors.#$e#Care for a game of chess, @? #$e#You wonder if there's a game I don't know? #$b#Ha! Amusing that you'd entertain such a notion. #$e#There isn't a board I haven't mastered. Consider me a grandmaster of, well... every kind of chess.$1",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.summer_Sat4": "It has been brought to my attention that the village always has a resident wizard. #$b#But I assure you, finding a wizard of my talent is not a common occurrence. #$e#Should you find yourself with any inquiries of magical nature, seek me out. #$e#My expertise is, as always, at your disposal.$3",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.summer_Sun4": "I hear your farm is home to many creatures—quite the menagerie, I imagine. #$e#Perhaps we ought to compare notes sometimes, no? #$e#I am no less informed than Halsin on the matter of animal husbandry and familiar summoning.",
//Summer 8 Hearts
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.summer_Mon8": "While my time is undoubtedly precious, should you find yourself in need of me, do not hesitate to ask, @.#$e#I shall assist where I can, especially when the challenge at hand demands arcane prowess.",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.summer_Tue8": "The sunlight has been splenidid of late! #$e#The weather here is far kinder than in Baldur's Gate, I must say. #$e#I'd love to take you there one day, but I fear the city's chaos and... #$b#distinctive lack of order might unsettle you. #$b#But then again, you may adapt in no time. After all, you are @.",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.summer_Wed8": "There is something about the season that fills me with contentment. #$b#Perhaps I've found far too much here worth studying.$3#$e#Either way, I suspect my grand plan—complete my research, return to Faerûn—has just been delayed yet again.$3",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.summer_Thu8": "There was a time when I placed great weight on glory and ambition, chasing them as though they were the only measures of a life well-lived. #$b#But, now that I've met you, grounded in a life I never quite envisioned, I find myself wondering if I ever truly understood what mattered at all.",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.summer_Fri8": "At times, I find myself wondering. #$e#Had we embarked on those adventures together, how different would things be? #$b#Would it be more exhilarating? #$e#Though the thought of losing a friend so dear...that is a gamble I could never bring myself to take again.",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.summer_Sat8": "If I smell less than ideal, well, you have the weather to blame. #$e#I could conjure a bit of rainfall, but I'd rather not waste my arcane abilities on a glorified bath.",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.summer_Sun8": "What invigorating weather, @! #$e#The golden sun, the warmth in the air...it all feels like an invitation. #$b#And who are we to ignore nature's call to adventure?$3",
///Fall
//Fall 0 Hearts
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.fall_Mon": "If I were to be perfectly honest, I find the individual in that tower rather...unpalatable. #$b#And I do try to be generous with my judgments. #$e#His so-called exceptional grasp of the arcane seems to manifest primarily as insufferable arrogance.#$e#Oh, come now! Whatever are you implying? I assure you, he and I are nothing alike.$5",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.fall_Tue": "Have you ever set foot upon that distant volcano? #$e#I've heard whispers of the most intriguing method of weapon enchantment found there. #$e#You cannot begin to fathom just how fascinated I am by such a prospect.",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.fall_Wed": "Strange, isn't it? #$e#Why is it that so few in this village have chosen to keep a cat? #$e#A place without its fair share of cat lovers lacks a certain...charm. #$b#And that is a void no amount of magic can properly fill.",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.fall_Thu": "I'm on the hunt for ingredients. #$e#Though, between us, I hardly need a stocked cupboard to work wonders. #$e#Even without Waterdeep's grand selection, I can still whisk up exceptional dishes.",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.fall_Fri": "I've been gathering wood for a campfire. #$e#The spells I do have for heat management are either inconveniently short-lived or catastrophically dangerous. #$e#Besides, I'm not keen on testing whether Halsin would invoke Silvanus' wrath upon seeing me wander the forest under a massive Fireball.",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.fall_Sat": "Evelyn shared some of her secret recipes with me a few days ago.#$e#I am at a loss for how to express my gratitude properly. #$e#Maybe, it's just how great chefs recognize one another. #$e#Much like wizards, I'd say. Elminster only needs one look at me to know exactly which scroll I'm after.",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.fall_Sun": "Hey, @! Autumn is the perfect time to harvest. #$e#If you're looking for advice on crop selection, consider my services at your disposal. #$e#Any seasoned gourmand would be happy to lend their expertise.$3",
//Fall 4 Hearts
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.fall_Mon4": "I believe it's time for a kitchen renovation. #$e#Back in Waterdeep, my tower had a fantastic setup—fully stocked and filled with my homemade Hundur sauce. #$e#Give it time, and I'll have this place up to par. #$e#Maybe even better.",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.fall_Tue4": "Should I visit...? #$b#Or perhaps not? #$e#Oh! My apologies, I was preoccupied. #$e#There's a fascinating magic circle in that wizard's basement. #$e#I wonder...should I take a closer look?#$e#Please, keep this between us. #$b#Better if he remains blissfully unaware of my...inquisitive intentions.",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.fall_Wed4": "You've seen Rolan's projection in the tavern, haven't you? #$e#He seems to be growing ever more fond of this ostentatious display of attention. #$b#Quite typical of a sorcerer. #$e#Innate power often comes with an equally innate flair for theatrics. $2#$e#Personally, I've always preferred the path of a wizard who, despite possessing outstanding talent, sees no need for unnecessary flamboyance.",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.fall_Thu4": "This season is perfect for crafting fine vintages. #$e#I have a wine cellar in Waterdeep. #$b#You ought to visit it someday. #$e#The local brews here have their charm, of course! But my collection is...let's just say, of a more elegant persuasion.",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.fall_Fri4": "Ah, greetings, @! #$e#Let's make the most of this season's harvest. #$e#Just think of all the crops waiting to be turned into something remarkable.",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.fall_Sat4": "Once, my companions and I stood at the edge of life and death, braving dangers that defied reason. #$e#We witnessed wonders beyond imagination—and horrors best left unspoken. #$e#To have survived such madness, only to find myself in the simplicity of this life... #$e#I do hope it isn't some warlock's well-crafted Dream.",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.fall_Sun4": "Winter is nearly upon us. #$b#Best to make preparations now! #$e#I'm gathering some firewood myself. #$e#Much safer than relying on magic for warmth. #$e#My student's experiences has taught me that a well-placed Fireball does little for comfort when the house is no longer standing.$2",
//Fall 8 Hearts
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.fall_Mon8": "I'm always refining my craft, both in the study of the Weave and in the kitchen. #$e#This way, should I find myself at an impasse in my arcane endeavors. #$b#I can counter with full justification that such matters lie well beyond the domain of a master chef. $3",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.fall_Tue8": "Busy times, I imagine? #$e#Know that I stand ready to assist in whatever way I can—no half-measures, I promise you.",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.fall_Wed8": "Apparently, I exude too much flair to be a scholar. #$e#Is that true, @? #$b#Lae'zel appears wholly unconvinced that I once held a professorship in Waterdeep.#$e#They really do have an awful lot of rules there. #$e#I wouldn't be surprised if they had a guideline on the proper way to tie one's boots.$2",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.fall_Thu8": "Pumpkins are the signature crop of the season. #$b#You can't have autumn without them. #$e#@, why not carve a Jack-o'-Lantern with me? #$b#I assure you, my knife work is impeccable. #$e#Years of precise slicing in the kitchen have seen to that.$3",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.fall_Fri8": "Everyone's busy harvesting their fields lately. #$e#I suppose I have reaped knowledge. #$e#A different kind of bounty, but a harvest in its own right. #$e#At the very least, my bookshelf is quite pleased with the new spellbooks I've stocked up. #$b#And what of you, @? Any exciting harvest to share, be they knowledge, crops, or otherwise?$3",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.fall_Sat8": "Given the chance, we should go camping sometimes, @. #$e#I'll see to it that only the freshest mushrooms and the ripest fruits find their way to our table. #$e#Rest assured, I know my mushrooms. #$b#No accidental adventures of the toxic variety, I promise. #$e#At the very least, I'll taste it first. #$e#Should tragedy strike, let it befall me—consider it an act of noble sacrifice.",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.fall_Sun8": "Back in my apprentice days, I could score top marks without even paying full attention. #$e#Who would've thought? #$b#After all my arcane studies, it's farm work that's besting me. #$e#Are we absolutely certain Halsin wouldn't lend a hand? #$b#A single Plant Growth and we'd be done before sundown.",
  //Winter
//Winter 0 Hearts
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.winter_Mon": "I think I'll be spending more time at home with my books this winter. #$b#So much knowledge, so little time! #$e#I feel like a sponge tossed straight into a lake—completely overwhelmed, but in the best possible way.",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.winter_Tue": "The other day, I found myself in the sewers—don't ask—and stumbled upon a... #$b#well, a black, amorphous something. #$e#I am no stranger to summoning oddities, but I have to say, I wasn't expecting this one to start a conversation.",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.winter_Wed": "......#$b#Hmm? What was that? #$e#Oh, sorry about that! Didn't notice you standing there. #$b#A wizard's got a lot on his mind. #$b#Sometimes it's hard to keep track of everything.",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.winter_Thu": "By the Weave, it's frigid outside! #$e#Better head home and get some rest, @.",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.winter_Fri": "Word has it that Ginger Island is home to parrots that can speak. #$e#Maybe they could befriend my dear Tara... #$b#or become part of the menu. #$e#Hard to say which she'd prefer.#$e#I'd rather not be responsible for breaking a young heart. #$e#Best she stays away from Ginger Island.$2",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.winter_Sat": "Magic could easily keep me warm through the winter, but that defeats the purpose of immersing myself in village life, wouldn't you say? #$e#I think I'll try adapting the old-fashioned way—properly this time. #$e#Much as I enjoy Create Bonfire, cantrip spells are not built for longevity. #$e#Firewood, on the other hand, doesn't just vanish after a minute.$2",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.winter_Sun": "Winter claims many lives. #$b#Some vanish without a trace. #$b#It unsettles me—this idea that unfairness is simply...the way of things. #$e#No hand—mortal or divine—should ever hold dominion over another's fate. #$b#And yet, time and again, they try.",
//Winter 4 Hearts
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.winter_Mon4": "Does this weather leave you feeling restless, @? #$e#How about a story? #$b#A particularly heroic one, starring none other than yours truly. #$e#One day, a drow, a dragonborn, and a cleric of Cyric walked into a bar... #$e#Hm? Lost already? No need to fret. #$e#I'll share more details next time. #$b#It'll be clear as crystal, I assure you.",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.winter_Tue4": "You must've met Tara by now. #$e#If not, I'll make sure to introduce you. #$e#I'm in the process of putting together a proper winter feast. #$e#Perhaps you and Tara would like to join? #$b#Good food always tastes better with good company.",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.winter_Wed4": "Working in this cold, @? #$e#Quite the ambition, my friend.",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.winter_Thu4": "Any plans for celebrating the year's end? #$e#I can't think of a better way than with my good friends and a truly decadent selection of wine. #$e#Would you believe it? #$b#Halsin tells me he's sworn off alcohol. #$e#I almost feel compelled to investigate whether this is some druidic trial.",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.winter_Fri4": "Life here brings me a rare kind of peace. #$e#I welcome each sunrise without the fear that it might be my last. #$e#It's a luxury, though most here don't even realize they have it.",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.winter_Sat4": "This village never seems to run out of competitions. #$e#I quite enjoy the thrill of it. #$e#There's something undeniably exhilarating about a good contest of skill.$1",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.winter_Sun4": "Greetings, @. #$e#It's a pleasure to have shared another year with you. #$e#I'm not one for large social circles, but knowing my presence is appreciated makes all the difference.$3",
//Winter 8 Hearts
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.winter_Mon8": "Another year draws to a close, @. #$e#I'd be remiss if I didn't take a moment to say thank you. #$e#Your company has been a gift. #$b#Meeting you, forging this connection...#$e#It was one of my wiser decisions.$3",
"30888_Gale.Dialogue.winter_Tue8": "Winter calls for warmth. #$e#I can think of no better way to pass the days than nestled by the fire, poring over ancient texts. Look closely at the tomes, and you'll see the ink shimmers in the firelight, much like a starlit sky.$3",

"Laezel.Dialogue.Sun4": "I hear the town's mines claim lives to monster attacks. #$b#I investigated. What I found was laughable. #$b#The so-called 'threats' there are as feeble as writhing maggots.$2#$e#You call this battle? #$b#Even imps had more bite than these wretches. #$b#Pathetic.",
//Spring 8 Hearts
"Laezel.Dialogue.Mon8": "Flowers and fragrance everywhere... #$e#Once, I despised such decadence—soft, cloying, a trap for the weak-willed. And yet... #$b#now, I find myself drawn to it.",

//Summer 0 Heart
"Laezel.Dialogue.summer_Mon": "My companions sacrificed much to build this small community. #$b#The place itself is...acceptable. #$e#In summer, the trees grow thick—ideal for an ambush. #$b#If war comes, it will serve.",
"Laezel.Dialogue.summer_Tue": "The mayor is a disappointment. #$e#He has no grasp of true crisis. #$b#No skill to command in the face of real danger. #$e#He busies himself with trivial matters. #$b#I doubt he would last a breath in true battle.",

//Summer 4 Hearts
"Laezel.Dialogue.summer_Mon4": "I prepared to flee and carve my own path, but my meddlesome companions saw fit to tether me to Faerûn instead. #$e#Then we came to this plane. Safe, perhaps, but mind-numbingly dull for a warrior.",
"Laezel.Dialogue.summer_Tue4": "The valley is suffocating in its stillness. #$b#Summer's peace makes me crave the roar of battle.#$e#Perhaps I can show you what real monsters look like when you finally grow tired of digging up dirt.",
"Laezel.Dialogue.summer_Wed4": "Best you stay out of the mine's depth. #$e#No, I mean even the creatures in the depths are pitifully weak. #$b#Useless for training.#$b#But try the desert caves if you're set on squandering your time. #$e#At least the prey there has some bite.",

"Laezel.Dialogue.summer_Sat4": "Every githyanki receives their sword at six years old. #$b#By ten, they have made their first kill. #$e#Yet the valley is infested with feeble whelps who couldn't gut a hatchling. That it still stands is nothing short of a miracle.",
"Laezel.Dialogue.summer_Sun4": "@, does your farm keep beasts, or is it as dull as the rest of this place? #$e#You should raise creatures of worth—dragons, for instance. #$b#Swift, deadly.#$e#Far better to have warriors at your side than idle pets that do nothing but eat and wander.",
//Summer 8 Hearts
"Laezel.Dialogue.summer_Mon8": "Life here is nothing like what I have known. #$b#My path was meant for battle and mastery... nothing more. #$e#Yet now, I find myself bound to this life...unwilling to leave it behind.",
"Laezel.Dialogue.summer_Tue8": "The day grows longer. #$b#I let the sun scorch me—burn weakness from my flesh, keep my mind honed.",
"Laezel.Dialogue.summer_Wed8": "I lack the words, but this...this is enough. #$e#I do not know what the future holds, but the valley proves itself to be adequate. #$b#I have found something unexpected...Hope.",
"Laezel.Dialogue.summer_Thu8": "In summer, steel weakens. #$b#Rust creeps in faster. #$e#I must tend to the blades with greater care.#$e#A warrior's duty is to keep their swords sharp. #$b#Always.",
"Laezel.Dialogue.summer_Fri8": "Astarion and I are old companions. #$e#He is worthy, despite his incessant prattle that makes one long to silence him permanently.",
"Laezel.Dialogue.summer_Sat8": "Dense forests, endless fields, people toiling without rest. #$e#I despised the sight of it when I first arrived.#$b#But now...it feels different.",

"Laezel.Dialogue.fall_Wed": "No, I have no time for idle chatter. #$e#My prey awaits.",

"Laezel.Dialogue.fall_Mon4": "You are still pitifully weak, @. #$b#But at least you show me more promise than the rest of these valley-dwellers.$1",
"Laezel.Dialogue.fall_Tue4": "I had warned my companions when they chose this land. #$e#The streams and lake seem serene, but enemies lurk easily within.",

"Laezel.Dialogue.fall_Thu4": "What weapon do you wield best? #$e#Do not tell me you plan to duel with that rusted hoe. At least arm yourself with something worthy.",
"Laezel.Dialogue.fall_Fri4": "The streams whisper of peace, but my hunger for battle remains unyielding and untamed.",
"Laezel.Dialogue.fall_Sat4": "The valley is rife with myths. #$e#Grand tales might be stirring, but I prefer battles fought with my own hands. True legends are carved in blood and steel.",

"Laezel.Dialogue.fall_Wed8": "Another day spent working? #$e#Your diligence is one of the few traits I respect.$3",
"Laezel.Dialogue.fall_Thu8": "Shadowheart's parents claim me as their own—I accept their devotion. #$e#I shall protect them as I would my own kin in return. #$b#None shall lay a hand on them and live.$3",
"Laezel.Dialogue.fall_Fri8": "This place...it draws me in. #$b#Life has shown me a path I had never considered. #$e#I will try to accept it, just as I have accepted you as my sworn ally.",
"Laezel.Dialogue.fall_Sat8": "Since coming here, I have cast aside many of the obsessions that once ruled me. #$e#I breathe easier—unburdened. What I have lost is nothing compared to what I have gained. #$b#Perhaps this is a lesson I have learned from you.",
"Laezel.Dialogue.fall_Sun8": "Your grit is undeniable. The farm stands as proof. #$b#Impressive. #$e#You keep it in line with discipline and patience. #$b#A warrior's traits, whether you see it or not.$3",

"Laezel.Dialogue.winter_Tue": "Speak. #$b#I expected you to huddle indoors like a trembling rabbit.",
"Laezel.Dialogue.winter_Wed": "Winter's snow makes every step a battle—perfect for training. #$b#If you cannot fight against the land itself, you are not fit to fight at all. #$e#The weak will do nothing but cower by the hearth, sleeping away their frailty.",
"Laezel.Dialogue.winter_Thu": "I have grown lax in my training. #$b#Unacceptable. I need a challenge worthy of my blade.",

//Winter 4 Hearts
"Laezel.Dialogue.winter_Mon4": "Working the fields even in this weather? Chk. #$e#You've earned a sliver of my respect. #$b#But it only puts you above the istiks of this valley. #$e#True strength is far beyond your reach.",
"Laezel.Dialogue.winter_Tue4": "My joints have stiffened lately. #$e#Life here is too idle. #$e#I must remain vigilant. Action, not reaction.",
"Laezel.Dialogue.winter_Wed4": "The weather is nothing. #$b#Stay diligent and continue your work, @. #$e#Only cowards fall to such a meager challenge.",
"Laezel.Dialogue.winter_Thu4": "Even after countless refusals, you persist. #$e#Hmph... @, you are more interesting than you first seemed.$1",
"Laezel.Dialogue.winter_Fri4": "Halsin remains obsessed with his herbs and remedies. #$e#Useful, perhaps. #$b#But on the battlefield, the best way to avoid injury is a swift, decisive strike.",
